- Single massive statistic in center
- Red/orange accent color for urgency
- Animated number count-up if possible

**Content**:
```
        39
      SECONDS

Every 39 seconds, a cyberattack
happens somewhere in the world.

Security teams are reading about
YESTERDAY's threats.

What if your news could predict
TOMORROW's attacks?
```

**Speaker Notes** (30 seconds):
> "Every 39 seconds, a cyberattack happens somewhere in the world. Security teams read hundreds of articles daily, but they're always REACTING to yesterday's threats. What if your security news could predict TOMORROW's attacks?"

**Design Elements**:
- "39" should be extremely large (200pt+ font)
- Rest of text fades in sequentially
- Question at end should be highlighted differently

### SLIDE 3: The Problem - Information Overload

**Visual Design**:
- Split into 3 problem cards/sections
- Icons for each problem
- Use red/warning colors to indicate pain
- Consider showing overwhelmed security analyst image

**Content**:
```
THE PROBLEM: Security Teams Are Drowning

[Icon: Stack of papers]        [Icon: Broken chain]        [Icon: Clock/Late]
INFORMATION                    MISSING                      REACTIVE
OVERLOAD                       CONNECTIONS                  POSTURE

50+ security articles          Threats evolve,              By the time you read
published daily                but we read                  about a vulnerability,
                               articles in isolation        attackers are exploiting it
```

**Speaker Notes** (45 seconds):
> "Here's the reality security teams face every day:
>
> First, INFORMATION OVERLOAD. Over 50 security articles are published daily. No one can read them all.
>
> Second, MISSING CONNECTIONS. Threats evolve across multiple stories, but we read each article in isolation. We miss the patterns.
>
> Third, REACTIVE POSTURE. By the time you read about a vulnerability, attackers are already planning their exploit.
>
> Security teams are drowning in news while attackers are planning their next move."

**Design Elements**:
- Three distinct columns
- Each with icon, headline, and 1-2 line description
- Progressive reveal animation recommended

### APPENDIX C: Prediction Methodology

**Content**:
```
PREDICTION METHODOLOGY

How we generate confidence scores:

1. PATTERN MATCHING
   Compare current indicators to historical vulnerability-to-exploit timelines

2. SEVERITY SCORING
   CVSS correlation with exploitation speed

3. THREAT ACTOR TRACKING
   Activity levels of known groups

4. MEDIA ATTENTION
   High visibility = higher exploitation probability

5. COMPOUND SCORING
   Weighted combination with uncertainty bounds
