SECURITY INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM

"Security intelligence that thinks ahead"

[Team SheepAI Logo]
Fonoa Hackathon 2025
```

**Speaker Notes** (10 seconds):
> "Good [morning/afternoon]. We're Team SheepAI, and we're going to show you how we're changing the way security teams consume intelligence."

---

### SLIDE 2: The Hook - Shocking Statistic

**Visual Design**:
- Full-screen dark background
- Single massive statistic in center
- Red/orange accent color for urgency
- Animated number count-up if possible

**Content**:
```
        39
      SECONDS

Every 39 seconds, a cyberattack
happens somewhere in the world.

Security teams are reading about
YESTERDAY's threats.

What if your news could predict
TOMORROW's attacks?
```

**Speaker Notes** (30 seconds):
> "Every 39 seconds, a cyberattack happens somewhere in the world. Security teams read hundreds of articles daily, but they're always REACTING to yesterday's threats. What if your security news could predict TOMORROW's attacks?"

**Design Elements**:
- "39" should be extremely large (200pt+ font)
- Rest of text fades in sequentially
- Question at end should be highlighted differently

---

### SLIDE 3: The Problem - Information Overload

**Visual Design**:
- Split into 3 problem cards/sections
- Icons for each problem
- Use red/warning colors to indicate pain
- Consider showing overwhelmed security analyst image

**Content**:
```
THE PROBLEM: Security Teams Are Drowning

[Icon: Stack of papers]        [Icon: Broken chain]        [Icon: Clock/Late]
INFORMATION                    MISSING                      REACTIVE
OVERLOAD                       CONNECTIONS                  POSTURE

50+ security articles          Threats evolve,              By the time you read
published daily                but we read                  about a vulnerability,
                               articles in isolation        attackers are exploiting it
```

**Speaker Notes** (45 seconds):
> "Here's the reality security teams face every day:
>
> First, INFORMATION OVERLOAD. Over 50 security articles are published daily. No one can read them all.
>
> Second, MISSING CONNECTIONS. Threats evolve across multiple stories, but we read each article in isolation. We miss the patterns.
>
> Third, REACTIVE POSTURE. By the time you read about a vulnerability, attackers are already planning their exploit.
>
> Security teams are drowning in news while attackers are planning their next move."

**Design Elements**:
- Three distinct columns
- Each with icon, headline, and 1-2 line description
- Progressive reveal animation recommended

---

### SLIDE 4: The Solution - Our Platform

2. KNOWLEDGE GRAPH - Discover hidden connections between threats
3. PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS - Get threat forecasts with confidence scores

NEW - ADVANCED FEATURES:
4. "EXPLAIN IT TO..." - Translate threats for CEO, Board, or Developers
5. 48-HOUR THREAT FORECAST - Hour-by-hour risk prediction timeline
6. THREAT DNA MATCHING - Find historical patterns and lessons learned
```

**Speaker Notes** (45 seconds):
> "We built a Security Intelligence Platform that doesn't just summarize news - it THINKS AHEAD.
>
> Core innovations:
> - Story Evolution Tracking - see how threats develop over time
> - Knowledge Graph - discover hidden connections that analysts would miss
> - Predictive Analytics - get threat forecasts with confidence scores
>
> Plus three advanced features:
> - Explain It To - instantly translate technical threats for executives
> - 48-Hour Forecast - see risk levels evolve hour by hour
> - Threat DNA - match current threats to historical patterns and lessons learned."

>
> **73% probability of exploit kits targeting this vulnerability within 14 days.**
>
> This is like a weather forecast for cybersecurity. Based on:
> - Historical patterns of vulnerability-to-exploit timelines
> - Current threat actor activity
> - Media attention as an exploitation predictor
>
> Our AI predicts what's LIKELY to happen next, with a confidence score you can act on."

TECHNICAL THREAT:                    FOR THE CEO:
"CVE-2024-1234 allows               "A security flaw could
remote code execution               let attackers take control
via buffer overflow..."             of our systems. 73% chance
                                    this happens in 2 weeks."

THREE AUDIENCES, ONE CLICK:
[CEO Icon]         [Board Icon]        [Developer Icon]
Business Impact    Governance & Risk    Technical Details
& Decisions        Assessment           & Fixes

"Bridge the gap between security teams and leadership"
```

**Speaker Notes** (30 seconds):
> "Security teams struggle to communicate with executives. Watch this - one click on 'Explain It To CEO' and the technical jargon becomes business language. Board members see governance risks. Developers get technical fixes. Same threat, three perspectives - instantly."

 |           |            |            |            |
LOW        MODERATE      HIGH        PEAK         DECLINING
(25%)       (45%)        (65%)       (78%)        (55%)

PEAK RISK: Hour 36 - 78% probability

KEY MILESTONES:
- Hour 8: Exploit code likely published
- Hour 24: Initial attack campaigns expected
- Hour 36: Maximum exploitation activity

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Patch critical systems within 8 hours
2. Enable enhanced monitoring by hour 12
3. Brief incident response team by hour 24

"Plan your defense before the attack arrives"
```

**Speaker Notes** (30 seconds):
> "This is a 48-hour weather forecast for cybersecurity. See exactly when risk peaks - hour 36 shows 78% probability. Key milestones tell you WHEN to act. Recommended actions give you a prioritized defense plan. Stop reacting, start planning."

[DNA Helix Visual with Match Cards]

CURRENT THREAT: Supply Chain Attack on PyPI Packages

HISTORICAL MATCHES:
+--------------------------------------------------+
| 78% MATCH - 2023 NPM Supply Chain Attack         |
| STRONG MATCH                                      |
|                                                  |
| What Happened: 500+ packages compromised         |
| Lessons Learned:                                 |
| - Rapid patching reduced impact                  |
| - Network segmentation limited spread            |
|                                                  |
| Shared Indicators: T1195, T1566, supply_chain    |
+--------------------------------------------------+

RECOMMENDED DEFENSES:
1. Enable dependency scanning
2. Implement code signing verification
3. Monitor for unusual package updates

"History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes - learn before it's too late"
```

**Speaker Notes** (30 seconds):
> "Threat DNA finds historical patterns. This supply chain attack matches a 2023 incident with 78% similarity. We already know what happened and what worked. Those lessons - rapid patching, network segmentation - become your playbook TODAY. Learn from history before repeating it."

### APPENDIX C: Prediction Methodology

**Content**:
```
PREDICTION METHODOLOGY

How we generate confidence scores:

1. PATTERN MATCHING
   Compare current indicators to historical vulnerability-to-exploit timelines

2. SEVERITY SCORING
   CVSS correlation with exploitation speed

3. THREAT ACTOR TRACKING
   Activity levels of known groups

4. MEDIA ATTENTION
   High visibility = higher exploitation probability

5. COMPOUND SCORING
   Weighted combination with uncertainty bounds
```
